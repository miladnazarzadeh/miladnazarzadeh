*Lancet. 2021 May 1;397(10285):1625-1636* | [DOI: 10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00590-0](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00590-0)

**High-level summaries of importance:**
- **Paradigm shift in hypertension guidelines**: Demonstrated that blood pressure lowering reduces cardiovascular risk by ~10% per 5 mm Hg reduction across all baseline BP levels, including normal ranges (<130 mm Hg), challenging traditional treatment thresholds.
- **Impact on global health policy**: With 1.3 billion people affected by hypertension worldwide, findings support treating based on cardiovascular risk rather than arbitrary BP thresholds, potentially preventing millions of cardiovascular events globally.

---

#### **2. Age-stratified and blood-pressure-stratified effects of blood-pressure-lowering pharmacotherapy**
*Lancet. 2021 Sep 18;398(10305):1053-1064* | [DOI: 10.1016/S0140-6736(21)01921-8](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)01921-8)

**High-level summaries of importance:**
- **Evidence for treatment in elderly populations**: Proved pharmacological BP reduction remains effective up to age 85 years, with consistent relative risk reductions across all age groups, supporting removal of age-related treatment thresholds from clinical guidelines.
- **Precision medicine approach**: Showed that while relative risk reductions are consistent, absolute benefits increase with age due to higher baseline risk, enabling better risk-stratified treatment decisions in clinical practice.

---

#### **3. Blood pressure lowering and risk of new-onset type 2 diabetes**
*Lancet. 2021 Nov 13;398(10313):1803-1810* | [DOI: 10.1016/S0140-6736(21)01920-6](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)01920-6)

**High-level summaries of importance:**
- **Dual cardiovascular-metabolic benefit**: Revealed that BP lowering reduces new-onset diabetes risk by 11% per 5 mm Hg reduction, with ACE inhibitors and ARBs showing the strongest protective effects, adding an important metabolic dimension to cardiovascular treatment.
- **Drug class-specific effects**: Identified that different antihypertensive classes have qualitatively different impacts on diabetes risk (protective vs harmful), providing critical evidence for personalised medication selection in at-risk populations.

---

#### **4. Blood pressure-lowering treatment in people with and without type 2 diabetes**
*Lancet Diabetes Endocrinol. 2022 Sep;10(9):645-654* | [DOI: 10.1016/S2213-8587(22)00172-3](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-8587(22)00172-3)

**High-level summaries of importance:**
- **Unified treatment approach for diabetes**: Demonstrated that BP-lowering treatment effects are similar in people with and without type 2 diabetes, refuting the need for differential BP thresholds based on diabetes status and simplifying clinical guidelines.
- **Evidence for 130 million people globally**: Provided robust evidence that people with diabetes benefit equally from BP reduction across all baseline levels, informing treatment for one of the world's largest chronic disease populations.

---

#### **5. Blood Pressure Lowering and Risk of Cancer: Individual Participant-Level Data Meta-Analysis**
